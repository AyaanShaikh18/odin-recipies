    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>This Chilean sea bass recipe is melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I had it at Blue Water Grill in NYC, and it was by far the best sea bass I've ever had in my life. This recipe tastes very close to what I had at that restaurant. They served it with bok choy and sticky rice on the side.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup sake</li>
        <li>⅓ cup mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup miso paste</li>
        <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 (4 ounce) fillets fresh sea bass, about 1 inch thick</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> Whisk together sake, mirin, miso paste, brown sugar, and soy sauce in a bowl. Place sea bass fillets in a large resealable plastic bag; pour marinade over fillets. Chill in the refrigerator for 3 to 6 hours. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Prop the oven door to remain slightly ajar. </li>
        <li>Arrange fillets on a baking sheet; discard marinade. </li>
        <li>Broil sea bass in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with chopped green onions to serve. </li>
    </ol>
